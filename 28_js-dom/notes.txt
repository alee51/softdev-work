DISCO:
- when you have colors in style tags in an HTML file, if you put multiple colors in the class="", the color defined later wins
  - e.g. if you define blue and then green and write <li class="green blue">item 2</li>, item 2 will be green
  - hence, the red() function only turns item 0 and item 7 red; the other items are overpowered by blue
  - similarly, the stripe() function doesn't work as is; the blue items never turn red
  - if you remove the classes for each list item, both red() and stripe() work as intended
- can get an element by ID: document.getElementById("thelist");
- can get a list of all elements with a certain tag name: document.getElementsByTagName("li");
- can create new elements: document.createElement("li"); 
- can add to a tree: list.appendChild(newitem);
- can add to an element's class list: items[i].classList.add('red');

QCC:
- when you run a function in the dev console, the appearance of the website changes without needing to reload!
- what is meant by "selected" in the comment "color selected elements red"? can you select specific list items?
- I tried to rewrite red() so that it works no matter what class list the element starts with. 
  It works, but for some reason I needed to do the process twice?
