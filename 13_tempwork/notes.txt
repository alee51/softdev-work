- lists in python can have multiple types
EGO
- cognitive dissonance
- it's bad to treat your code as an extension of yourself,
because then you don't look for errors and instead ignore them
- the ability to acknowledge your limitations makes you a better programmer
- referring to work as "code you wrote" instead of "your code" 
can help you detach yourself from it
- people usually don't focus on the social aspect of programming
- egoless programming is a good practice not only because it reduces
the number of errors, but also because it encourages people to write
code that is clear and understandable
- sharing your code with people reduces variation and increases adaptability
