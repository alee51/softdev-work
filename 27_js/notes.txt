K27 - Basic functions in JavaScript
2025-01-06m

DISCO:
- "var" and  "let" in JS correspond to "define" in Scheme
- "function" in JS corresponds to "lambda" in Scheme
  - tells JS that you are defining a function
- JS uses infix notation, semicolons, curly braces, and return statements like Java does
- can include JS in HTML using <script src="foo.js"></script>

QCC:
- can you run JS in the terminal as well as the dev console, or only in the dev console?
- is there a way to run the test calls from the script in the console?
