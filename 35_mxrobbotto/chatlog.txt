Please read the following assignment and produce an app that satisfies the requirements.

Your team has been contracted to create a collaborative storytelling game/website, with the following features:

    Users will have to register to use the site.
    Logged-in users can either start a new story or add to an existing story.
    When adding to a story,
        Users are shown only the latest update to the story, not the whole thing.
        A user can then add some amount of text to the story.
    Once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again.
    When creating a new story,
        Users get to start with any amount of text and give the story a title.
        Logged in users will be able to read any story they have contributed to on their homepage (the landing page after login).
Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework.
SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system.
Multiple Python files should be used, as necessary, for application layer. (a.k.a. "middleware" modules, etc.)

To create a collaborative storytelling game/website using Flask and SQLite3, we will structure our application into multiple Python files to handle different aspects of the application. Here is how we can organize the files and implement the features:
Code

/collaborative_story
|-- /static
|-- /templates
|-- app.py
|-- auth.py
|-- database.py
|-- models.py
|-- story.py
|-- utils.py

Here is the implementation of each file:

    app.py: This is the main entry point of the application.

Public code references from 6 repositories

    auth.py: This handles user authentication.

Public code references from 9 repositories

    database.py: This handles database initialization and connection.

Public code references from 7 repositories

    models.py: This defines the database schema.

Public code references from 6 repositories

    story.py: This handles story creation and contribution.

Public code references from 6 repositories

    utils.py: Utility functions, if needed.

    templates/index.html: The homepage template.

Public code references from 7 repositories

    templates/register.html: The registration page template.

Public code references from 10 repositories

    templates/login.html: The login page template.

Public code references from 18 repositories

    templates/home.html: The user home page template.

Public code references from 10 repositories

    templates/new_story.html: The new story page template.

Public code references from 13 repositories

    templates/add_to_story.html: The add to story page template.

Public code references from 13 repositories

This structure and code should help you create a collaborative storytelling game/website that meets the specified requirements.
