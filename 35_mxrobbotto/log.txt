K34 -- prompting github copilot to complete p0
2025-03-12
Time Spent: _ hours

DISCO:
- need to enable copilot to access public code, or else it won't write code
- be patient as the copilot is answering (reloading the page will stop it)
- copilot response gives citations!

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
Error #1: 
@app.before_first_request
AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'before_first_request'. Did you mean: '_got_first_request'?

I showed copilot the error and asked it to fix it. The updated app.py it outputted no longer triggered the error.

Error #2: 
In the original list of files, the file with SQL was named model.py, so when I ran the app, I got FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'schema.sql'

I renamed model.py to schema.sql, leading to the first working version of the app.
q2:
