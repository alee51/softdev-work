K35 -- prompting github copilot to complete p0
2025-03-17
Time Spent: 3 hours

DISCO:
- need to enable copilot to access public code, or else it won't write code
- be patient as the copilot is answering (reloading the page will stop it)
- copilot response gives citations!
- had many mistakes, but was able to revise them once prompted, did not break on itself
- issues with flash messages, orginally not display them, then displayed on web page as opposed to as a pop down message
- delays with presentation of flash messsages
- no css/design elements
- can retrieve previous versions of code, since copilot automatically re-writes code
- each file has a different amount of versions as they can be updated seperately

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
11?

q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?

Error #1: 
@app.before_first_request
AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'before_first_request'. Did you mean: '_got_first_request'?

I showed copilot the error and asked it to fix it. The updated app.py it outputted no longer triggered the error.

Error #2: 
In the original list of files, the file with SQL was named model.py, so when I ran the app, I got FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'schema.sql'

I renamed model.py to schema.sql, leading to the first working version of the app.

Error #3: 
jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: story.home

I showed copilot the error and asked it to fix it. It showed me the file structure it intended, so I changed the file structure in my repo to match that.
It intended for there to be an auth directory and a story directory within the templates directory. story.py was written with this intention but auth.py was not, so I fixed auth.py manually.

q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?

A lot of aspects were quite similar; the overall flask setup, login/register/logout processes were essentially the same. However, my old team didn't use any .sql files, so I was interested to see that.

C: I was impressed by the quality of the code; it eventually worked and took a lot less time than we needed originally!
