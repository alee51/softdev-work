Collaborative storytelling game app implementation
ME: Please read the following assignment and produce an app that satisfies the requirements.

Your team has been contracted to create a collaborative storytelling game/website, with the following features:

    Users will have to register to use the site.
    Logged-in users can either start a new story or add to an existing story.
    When adding to a story,
        Users are shown only the latest update to the story, not the whole thing.
        A user can then add some amount of text to the story.
    Once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again.
    When creating a new story,
        Users get to start with any amount of text and give the story a title.
        Logged in users will be able to read any story they have contributed to on their homepage (the landing page after login).
Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework.
SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system.
Multiple Python files should be used, as necessary, for application layer. (a.k.a. "middleware" modules, etc.)

COPILOT: To create a collaborative storytelling game/website using Flask and SQLite3, we will structure our application into multiple Python files to handle different aspects of the application. Here is how we can organize the files and implement the features:

Code
/collaborative_story
|-- /static
|-- /templates
|-- app.py
|-- auth.py
|-- database.py
|-- models.py
|-- story.py
|-- utils.py
Here is the implementation of each file:

app.py: This is the main entry point of the application.

app.py
v1
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, session
from auth import auth_bp
from story import story_bp
from database import init_db

 Public code references from 6 repositories
auth.py: This handles user authentication.

auth.py
v1
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session, flash
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from database import get_db

auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')
 Public code references from 9 repositories
database.py: This handles database initialization and connection.

database.py
v1
import sqlite3
from flask import g

DATABASE = 'collaborative_story.db'

 Public code references from 7 repositories
models.py: This defines the database schema.

schema.sql
v1
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL
);
 Public code references from 6 repositories
story.py: This handles story creation and contribution.

story.py
v1
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session
from database import get_db

story_bp = Blueprint('story', __name__, url_prefix='/story')

 Public code references from 6 repositories
utils.py: Utility functions, if needed.

templates/index.html: The homepage template.


templates/index.html
v1
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Collaborative Storytelling</title>
 Public code references from 7 repositories
templates/register.html: The registration page template.

templates/register.html
v1
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Register</title>
 Public code references from 10 repositories
templates/login.html: The login page template.

templates/login.html
v1
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Login</title>
 Public code references from 18 repositories
templates/home.html: The user home page template.

templates/home.html
v1
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Home</title>
 Public code references from 10 repositories
templates/new_story.html: The new story page template.

templates/new_story.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>New Story</title>
 Public code references from 13 repositories
templates/add_to_story.html: The add to story page template.

templates/add_to_story.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Add to Story</title>
 Public code references from 13 repositories
This structure and code should help you create a collaborative storytelling game/website that meets the specified requirements.

ME: Trying to run the code, I get this error:

@app.before_first_request
AttributeError: 'Flask' object has no attribute 'before_first_request'. Did you mean: '_got_first_request'?

can you fix this?
COPILOT: It looks like the before_first_request decorator has been deprecated or removed in the version of Flask you are using. Instead, you can use the before_request decorator and a flag to ensure that the database is initialized only once. Here's the updated app.py file:


app.py
v2
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, session
from auth import auth_bp
from story import story_bp
from database import init_db

This ensures that the database is initialized only once before the first request is processed.

When I ran the app again, I got this error:
Please provide the error message you encountered so I can help you debug it.

sqlite3.OperationalError: table users already exists

can you fix this?
The error sqlite3.OperationalError: table users already exists indicates that the database initialization script is attempting to create tables that already exist. To handle this, we can modify the init_db function to check if the tables already exist before attempting to create them.

Here's the updated database.py:


database.py
v2
import sqlite3
from flask import g

DATABASE = 'collaborative_story.db'

 Public code references from 3 repositories
This modification ensures that the database tables are only created if they do not already exist. This should prevent the sqlite3.OperationalError from occurring.

Make sure to also include the close_db function in your app.py to ensure the database connection is properly closed after each request:


app.py
v3
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, session
from auth import auth_bp
from story import story_bp
from database import init_db, close_db

 1 vulnerability detected
With these adjustments, the app should now properly handle the database initialization and connection management.

Can you fix the app so that if a user tries to login to an account that isn't in the database, they are redirected to register?
To implement this feature, we need to modify the login route in the auth.py file to redirect users to the registration page if the provided credentials do not match any existing user in the database. Here is the updated auth.py file:


auth.py
v2
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session, flash
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from database import get_db

auth_bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')
 Public code references from 8 repositories
 1 vulnerability detected
In this updated auth.py file, the login route now checks if the user exists in the database. If the user does not exist, the user is redirected to the registration page with a flash message indicating that they need to register. If the user exists but the password is incorrect, a flash message is shown indicating invalid credentials. If the credentials are correct, the user is logged in and redirected to the home page.

I still get this error whenever I re-run the app: sqlite3.OperationalError: table users already exists

can you fix this?
To fix the issue where the database tables already exist, you can modify the init_db function to drop the existing tables before creating them. This approach ensures that you always start with a fresh database schema. However, be aware that this will delete all existing data in the database every time the function is run.

Here is the updated database.py:


database.py
v3
import sqlite3
from flask import g

DATABASE = 'collaborative_story.db'

 Public code references from 3 repositories
Update the schema.sql to include DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements to ensure that the tables are dropped before being created:


schema.sql
v2
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stories;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS contributions;

CREATE TABLE users (
 Public code references from 3 repositories
This ensures that any existing tables are dropped before the new tables are created, preventing the sqlite3.OperationalError: table users already exists error.

Can you fix the app so that when user credentials are saved in the database between sessions?
To ensure that user credentials are saved persistently in the database between sessions, we need to make sure that the session management and database interactions are properly handled. The issue might be related to how the session is managed. Here is the complete code with necessary corrections to ensure that user credentials are saved and managed properly:

Copilot was interrupted before it could finish this message.

ME: Can you just fix the schema.sql file so that the database doesn't drop the tables if they already exist, it only creates new tables if it doesn't exist

COPILOT: Sure, we can update the schema.sql file to only create the tables if they do not already exist. Here is the updated schema.sql file:


schema.sql
v4
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL
);
This will create the tables only if they do not already exist, preventing the sqlite3.OperationalError: table users already exists error.

Can you fix the app so that users get logged out between runs?
To ensure users are logged out between runs, we need to clear the session data when the application starts. This can be done by adding a function that clears the session data and calling this function at the beginning of the application.

Here's the updated app.py to include this functionality:


app.py
v5

 1 vulnerability detected
This modification ensures that the session data is cleared when the application starts, effectively logging out any users between runs.

Additionally, make sure to set the SESSION_PERMANENT configuration to False to ensure the session data is not stored permanently:


app.py
v6
 1 vulnerability detected
Here is the updated app.py with the SESSION_PERMANENT configuration as well:


app.py
v7

 2 vulnerabilities detected
This should ensure that users are logged out between runs.

ME: When I tried to register with an existing username, I got this error: sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: users.username

Can you fix the app so that it shows a flash message instead of breaking?

COPILOT: To handle the sqlite3.IntegrityError and show a flash message when a user tries to register with an existing username, we need to add error handling in the register route of the auth.py file.

Here is the updated auth.py file:


auth.py
v4

 Public code references from 7 repositories
This modification catches the sqlite3.IntegrityError when attempting to insert a duplicate username and shows a flash message to the user instead of breaking the application.

ME: Can you fix the app so that when you try to log in with an incorrect password, it shows a flash message?
COPILOT: To show a flash message when a user tries to log in with an incorrect password, we need to update the login route in the auth.py file. Here is the updated auth.py file:


auth.py
v5

 Public code references from 7 repositories
In this updated auth.py file, the login route checks if the user exists and if the password is correct. If the user exists but the password is incorrect, a flash message is shown to indicate invalid credentials. If the user does not exist, a flash message is shown to prompt the user to register. If the credentials are correct, the user is logged in and redirected to the home page.

The flash messages are not appearing. can you fix this?
To ensure that flash messages appear, we need to make sure that the flash function is used correctly and that the templates are set up to display these messages.

First, let's add the necessary code to display flash messages in the templates.

File: templates/base.html

templates/base.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
 Public code references from 5 repositories
Next, extend this base.html in your other templates.

File: templates/index.html

templates/index.html
v3
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Collaborative Storytelling{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
 Public code references from 12 repositories
File: templates/register.html

templates/register.html
v3
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Register{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
 Public code references from 22 repositories
File: templates/login.html

templates/login.html
v3
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Login{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
 Public code references from 22 repositories
Finally, ensure that you have the necessary imports and configurations in your app.py:

File: app.py

app.py
v8

 Public code references from 15 repositories
 1 vulnerability detected
With these changes, flash messages should now appear correctly on your pages.

ME: Can you fix the app so that once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again?

COPILOT: To ensure that a user can only add to a story once, we need to modify the logic in the add_to_story route in the story.py file. We will check if the user has already contributed to the story, and if so, we will show a message indicating that they cannot add to the story again.

Here is the updated story.py file:


story.py
v3

This modification ensures that a user can only add to a story once. If the user has already contributed to the story, a flash message will be shown indicating that they cannot add to it again.

ME: Can you fix the app so that the flash message is shown on the current page instead of on the index page?

COPILOT: To ensure that the flash message is shown on the current page instead of redirecting to the index page, we need to render the current page template with the flash message.

Here is how you can update the auth.py and story.py files:

File: auth.py

auth.py
v6

 Public code references from 7 repositories
File: story.py

story.py
v4

 Public code references from 4 repositories
With these changes, the flash messages will be shown on the current page instead of redirecting to the index page. The templates need to be set up to display flash messages, as shown in the previous response.

When I contribute to a story, a second link is added. Can you fix this so that each story only ever has one link?
To ensure that each story only ever has one link, we need to update the home route in the story.py file to retrieve distinct stories that the user has contributed to.

Here is the updated story.py file:


story.py
v5
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, session, flash
from database import get_db

story_bp = Blueprint('story', __name__, url_prefix='/story')

This change ensures that each story only appears once on the home page by using the DISTINCT keyword in the SQL query.

ME: can you fix the app so that the user sees the links to all the stories, not just their own?

COPILOT: To ensure that the user sees links to all the stories, not just the ones they have contributed to, we need to modify the home route in the story.py file to retrieve all the stories from the database.

Here's the updated story.py file:


story.py
v6

This change ensures that all stories are retrieved from the database and displayed on the home page, not just the ones the user has contributed to.

File: templates/home.html

templates/home.html
v3
This template will list all the stories with links to add to each story, allowing the user to see and interact with all stories in the database.

ME: I got this error when I tried to reopen a story: jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: story.home
can you fix this?

COPILOT: The error jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound: story.home indicates that the template story/home.html is not found. This usually happens when the template file is not in the expected location or the path is incorrectly specified.

To fix this, ensure that the home.html template exists in the templates/story directory and that the path is correctly specified.

Here is how the directory structure should look:

Code
/collaborative_story
|-- /static
|-- /templates
|   |-- /auth
|   |   |-- login.html
|   |   |-- register.html
|   |-- /story
|   |   |-- add_to_story.html
|   |   |-- home.html
|   |   |-- new_story.html
|-- app.py
|-- auth.py
|-- database.py
|-- models.py
|-- story.py
|-- utils.py
|-- schema.sql
Ensure that the home.html file exists in the templates/story directory.

File: templates/story/home.html

templates/story/home.html
Additionally, ensure that the render_template function in the home route in story.py correctly specifies the path to the home.html template:

File: story.py

story.py
v7

These changes ensure that the correct template is found and rendered, preventing the jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound error.
