# K22: Testing On-Ramps + Other FEFs
lilyPigs: Anastasia Lee, Andy Shyklo
## DISCO
- Dropdown menu doesn't work without JS
- In body, insert `background-image: url('path/to/image')` to change the website background to an image of your choosing
- `background-repeat` determines whether the background image repeats after it ends
- Use `img` element to insert images
- `overflow: hidden` disables scrolling

- You have to add the script within the head for tailwind using `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- You can add styling within tailwind using another script, an within it using tailwind.config to configure elements like theme, font, and colors

## QCC
- Not all images work well as a background; it's best to choose one that has a seamless transition between the bottom to the top of its repetitions
- Foundation and bootstrap are both similar to normal HTML and CSS
- What is the purpose of the z-index in the overlay formatting?
- How can I put two overlay images side-by-side?
- When is one FEF better suited for a project than another?

## Q0: Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp?
1
## Q0b: If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.
Asked Jady whether she used any JS, and which line in the app.css file disables scrolling
## Q1: At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why?
I think I prefer Bootstrap, because it is quite versatile and does not depend on CSS and JS as much as the other FEFs do.
